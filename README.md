# Krill

> Desired state configuration for [Docker][docker] images. ü¶ê

The goal of `krill` is to provide a simple way to create [Docker][docker] images and configure containers at runtime.

## Introduction

In the past decade, system administrators have moved from virtual machines configured with tools like [Ansible][ansible], [Puppet][puppet] or [Chef][chef], to lighter containers powered by [Docker][docker] and managed by orchestrators such as [Kubernetes][kubernetes] or [Docker compose][compose]. 

While this shift made services more scalable, and simplified the management of large fleets of containers, it has also been a huge setback in term of how the containers themselves are defined.
Indeed, [Ansible playbooks][playbooks] have been replaced by monolithic shell scripts, which not exactly known for their advanced error handling or expressive logging.

This is the gap `krill` aims at bridging by providing:

- [ ] An idempotent, maintainable, powerful and extensible *Domain Specific Language (DSL)*.
- [ ] A complete suite of builtin resources that ensure a small footprint and usage of best practice.
